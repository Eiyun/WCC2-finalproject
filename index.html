                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <h4>The urban sprawl</h4>

                <p>
                    Urban sprawl is defined as "the spreading of urban developments (such as houses 
                    and shopping centers) on undeveloped land near a city." Urban sprawl has been 
                    described as the unrestricted growth in many urban areas of housing, commercial 
                    development, and roads over large expanses of land, with little concern for urban 
                    planning.</p>
                 
                <p>The natural environment is greatly affected by urban sprawl. The expansion of cities 
                    has led to the loss of natural habitats and increased pollution levels. When natural 
                    spaces are replaced by pavement, roads, buildings or parking lots, it affects the 
                    ability of animal and plant species to survive. The fragmentation of natural habitats 
                    can lead to a reduction in biodiversity and the loss of valuable species. Urban sprawl 
                    also affects water resources, soils, and air quality, transforming them to become 
                    polluted due to increased human activities. According to Ho et al. (2007), 
                    urbanization contributes to pollution emissions, loss of biodiversity and degradation 
                    of environmental quality.
                    The impacts of urban sprawl on the natural environment are wide-ranging. The 
                    adoption of a "drive-everywhere" culture has led to increased vehicle emissions 
                    which exacerbates air pollution, harming the natural environment (Ewing et al., 2016). 
                    The nonpoint source pollution caused by increased impermeable surfaces in urban 
                    centers contributes to the loss of natural water quality, leading to a reduction in the 
                    availability of aquatic habitat (Hough, 2005). Similarly, the land-use changes required 
                    for urbanization result in a loss of green space which negatively impacts outdoor 
                    recreation areas, public health, and the mental well-being of citizens (Van den Berg 
                    et al., 2007). <p>

                <h4> Reflections on urban sprawl</h4>


                <p> With today's trend of urban sprawl, it made me reflect on why cities need sprawl 
                    rather than rational development, why sprawl is increasing and whether nature is like 
                    a lamb to the slaughter in front of mankind.In the past, when technology was not yet 
                    developed, humans lived in harmony with nature, but when technology accelerated 
                    and humans had the power forged by technology, everything seemed to change and 
                    we were free to fantasise about transforming the natural environment and making it a 
                    sacrifice for our personal desires.
                    This is the embodiment of the power relationship between humans and nature. Often 
                    when those who wield power want to control the dominated, it only takes the simplest 
                    of gestures for the wielder to make the dominated a victim of their own desires, and 
                    thus power in the hands of humans is the fundamental cause of urban sprawl. </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <h4>Project idea</h4>
                <p> In this project I have conceived an interactive device that brings together technology, humans 
                    and power - a robotic arm - and plan to install it on a miniature landscape.
                    In order to express my thoughts on the relationship with power, participants will experience 
                    the act of using power for "urban sprawl" as a way of feeling the relationship between 
                    humans and nature. Amongst other things, they will use the simplest of gestures: up, down, 
                    left and right as the main interaction of the piece. <p>

                    <h7>Sketch </h7>
                    </section>


                <h4>Programming Code</h4>
                <p> At first, I intended to use only ml5.js hand skeleton tracking to get information about the 
                    user's hands. I read and researched a lot about ml5.js gesture recognition and connecting to 
                    Arduino, and initially I solved most of the gesture recognition problems through programming, 
                    but in the process of testing the code after trying to use it in conjunction with servo motors, I 
                    found that ml5.js could recognise left heel right gestures well, but not up and down gestures 
                    well, even with the use of finger skeleton tracking So I had to try and find another way that 
                    would work.
                    Eventually I found a gesture sensor called paj7620. After using this gesture recognition 
                    sensor, the gesture issues I was having with ml5.js and some glitches and sensitivity issues 
                    were resolved, allowing me to test and carry out the project more effectively, so I decided to 
                    use a combination of paj7620 and ml5.js gesture recognition to complete the project. <p>

                <h4>Physical installation</h4>
                <p> This physical installation consists of two parts, a miniature scene that simulates a natural 
                    landscape and a robotic arm made up of servo motors. <p> 
                
                <h5>The robot arm</h5>
                <p>  I first drew its structure using software, then used a 3D printer to punch out 
                    the parts and finally completed the assembly. <p>

                <h5>Miniature scene</h5>
                <p>  I used a number of composite materials such as newspaper, lime dust, 
                    stones and fake grass. <p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>In the future, I plan to make this project bigger, include more miniature landscapes as well as 
                    robotic arms in it, and continue to experiment with the gesture recognition code using ml5.js, 
                    aiming to include more interesting gesture recognition in this project than simply going up 
                    and down.</p>

                 <h3>Self evaluation</h3>
                 <p>I encountered many difficulties while working on the project, for example, on the code side, 
                    writing the code for the gestures in the ml5.js gesture recognition library, which turned out 
                    not to be feasible during testing, and on the physical programming side, testing the data of 
                    each servo motor to make it move as smoothly as possible. These were all great challenges 
                    and allowed me to gain many programming skills in the process.
                    The finished project looks a little more monotonous and less flashy in terms of human computer interaction, but I think that's exactly what I was trying to say: "The powerhouse 
                    needs only the simplest of actions to make manipulated dedicated to it”.
                    Making the miniature landscape was also a big challenge, and although this creation was 
                    more complete, I still overlooked some details, such as matching the physical installation for 
                    hidden wiring. But in any case, I gained a lot from this project, especially the knowledge 
                    about the code that combines the gesture recognition function of ml5.js with the physical 
                    device, and I believe I will use both technologies more often in the future.</p>
